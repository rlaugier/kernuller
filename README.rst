kernuller: a python package for designing an testing kernel-nulling architectures
=====================================================================

Kernuller builds upon the foundation layed out by Martinache & Ireland 2018, and 
includes the generative designs proposed by Laugier et al. 2020 (in prep.).
In particular, it allows to create of kernel-nulling objexts that are based upon
matrices defined in symbolic math, and the matrix A of second order derivatives.

It also allows to plot complex matrices such as optical combiner matrices in the
style proposed in Laugier et al. 2020 (in prep.), as well as to map the response
map of interferometers to on-sky signal.

Additional dependences:
-----------------------

sympy
tqdm
lmfit


Usage
-----


This is not a stable release. Interfaces of methods will evolve.
